# FBG6HoneyBag
Additional compartment for electronics for the Flying Bear Ghost 6 printer

The HoneyBag project appeared as a result of the reluctance to make a basement for the printer and the desire to use the Clipper. Since the standard electronics compartment does not allow you to install a Raspberry Pi or an analog there without the risk of unstable operation, it was decided to put additional electronics in a separate compartment behind the printer and attach it to the back panel, which is almost never removed for printer maintenance.
The HoneyBag contains: a BTT Pi with an installed U2C module, as well as a BTT Relay module for printer power management.
HoneyBag has the ability to quickly access the flash card and BTT Pi connectors, as well as the installation of a 5010 fan to cool the processor.
In order to preserve the compactness and convenience of connecting the power cable, the standard power connector with an integrated power button has been replaced with a separate option: a separate power connector with a fuse and a power button.
Structurally, the HoneyBag consists of six parts optimized for printing on a printer with a table size of at least 235 mm in X or Y. A minimum of screw connections is used during assembly.
ABS is better for printing, but HoneyBag can be printed from any other plastic except soft plastics.

For printing, it is optimal to use the following parameters: four perimeters, five layers of bottom and lid, 40% gyroid filling.
